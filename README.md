> **DISCLAIMER**: Proof-of-concept for educational and security research purposes only. Demonstrates privacy vulnerabilities in WhatsApp and Signal.

## Overview

This project implements the research from the paper **"Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers"** by Gabriel K. Gegenhuber, Maximilian Günther, Markus Maier, Aljosha Judmayer, Florian Holzbauer, Philipp É. Frenzel, and Johanna Ullrich (University of Vienna & SBA Research).

**What it does:** By measuring Round-Trip Time (RTT) of WhatsApp message delivery receipts, this tool can detect:
- When a user is actively using their device (low RTT)
- When the device is in standby/idle mode (higher RTT)
- Potential location changes (mobile data vs. WiFi)
- Activity patterns over time

**Security implications:** This demonstrates a significant privacy vulnerability in messaging apps that can be exploited for surveillance.

## Example

![WhatsApp Activity Tracker Interface](example.png)

The web interface shows real-time RTT measurements, device state detection, and activity patterns.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/gommzystudio/device-activity-tracker.git
cd device-activity-tracker

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 20+, npm, WhatsApp account

## Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
npm run start:server

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
npm run start:client
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, scan QR code with WhatsApp, then enter phone number to track (e.g., `491701234567`).

### CLI Interface (only WhatsApp)

```bash
npm start
```

Follow prompts to authenticate and enter target number.

**Example Output:**

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Device Status Update - 09:41:51                                ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ JID:        ***********@lid                                    ║
║ Status:     Standby                                            ║
║ RTT:        1104ms                                             ║
║ Avg (3):    1161ms                                             ║
║ Median:     1195ms                                             ║

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

- **Online**: Device is actively being used (RTT below threshold)
- **Standby**: Device is idle/locked (RTT above threshold)
- **Offline**: Device is offline or unreachable (no CLIENT ACK received)

## How It Works

The tracker sends probe messages and measures the Round-Trip Time (RTT) to detect device activity. Two probe methods are available:

### Probe Methods

| Method | Description                                                                                                     |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Delete** (Default) | Sends a "delete" request for a non-existent message ID.                                                         |
| **Reaction** | Sends a reaction emoji to a non-existent message ID. |

### Detection Logic

The time between sending the probe message and receiving the CLIENT ACK (Status 3) is measured as RTT. Device state is detected using a dynamic threshold calculated as 90% of the median RTT: values below the threshold indicate active usage, values above indicate standby mode. Measurements are stored in a history and the median is continuously updated to adapt to different network conditions.

### Switching Probe Methods

In the web interface, you can switch between probe methods using the dropdown in the control panel. In CLI mode, the delete method is used by default.

## Common Issues

- **Not Connecting to WhatsApp**: Delete the `auth_info_baileys/` folder and re-scan the QR code.

## How to Protect Yourself

The most effective mitigation is to enable “Block unknown account messages” in WhatsApp under
Settings → Privacy → Advanced.

This setting may reduce an attacker’s ability to spam probe reactions from unknown numbers, because WhatsApp blocks high-volume messages from unknown accounts.
However, WhatsApp does not disclose what “high volume” means, so this does not fully prevent an attacker from sending a significant number of probe reactions before rate-limiting kicks in.

Disabling read receipts helps with regular messages but does not protect against this specific attack. As of December 2025, this vulnerability remains exploitable in WhatsApp and Signal.

## Ethical & Legal Considerations

For research and educational purposes only. Never track people without explicit consent - this may violate privacy laws. Authentication data (`auth_info_baileys/`) is stored locally and must never be committed to version control.
